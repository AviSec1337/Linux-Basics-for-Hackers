## 1. General Linux Commands

### Tasks:
1. Create a directory structure for a project:
   ```
   project/
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
   â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
   ```
2. List all files in the `/etc` directory that contain the word "conf" in their name.
3. Find the largest 5 files in your home directory.
4. Create a tar archive of the `/var/log` directory and compress it using Gzip.

---

## 2. File Permissions

### Tasks:
1. Create a file `secure.txt` with `rw-r-----` permissions.
2. Add a sticky bit to a shared directory so that only file owners can delete their files.
3. Use ACL to grant a specific user write access to a file they donâ€™t own.

---

## 3. Networking

### Tasks:
1. Use `ping` to check connectivity with an external server.
2. Capture network packets on a specific interface using `tcpdump` and analyze them in Wireshark.
3. Create a simple script that scans a range of IP addresses for open ports.

---

## 4. Bash Scripting

### Tasks:
1. Write a script to back up a directory to a specified location, appending the date to the archiveâ€™s name.
2. Automate cleaning up old log files (older than 7 days) in a specific directory.
3. Create a script to monitor CPU usage and alert if it exceeds 80%.

---

## 5. Python Scripting

### Tasks:
1. Create a Python script to encrypt and decrypt a file using the `cryptography` library.
2. Write a script to fetch and display the latest weather information from a public API.
3. Build a chat application using Python sockets for communication between two systems.

---

## 6. Security and Anonymity

### Tasks:
1. Configure a firewall using `ufw` to allow SSH traffic and block all other incoming connections.
2. Set up Tor for anonymous browsing and verify its functionality.
3. Monitor failed login attempts using `/var/log/auth.log` and write a summary report.

---

## 7. Kernel and Module Management

### Tasks:
1. List all loaded kernel modules and find their sizes.
2. Insert and remove a custom kernel module.
3. Enable IP forwarding using `sysctl` and verify its effect.

---

## 8. Automating Tasks

### Tasks:
1. Schedule a cron job to clean up temporary files every day at midnight.
2. Create a `systemd` timer to run a backup script weekly.
3. Use the `at` command to schedule a task to send an alert email in 1 hour.

---

## 9. Wireless Network Analysis

### Tasks:
1. Use `airodump-ng` to capture packets for a specific wireless network.
2. Test the signal strength of nearby networks using `nmcli`.
3. Secure your wireless router by disabling WPS and enabling WPA3.

---

## 10. Advanced Scenarios

### Tasks:
1. Rebuild the Linux kernel with a custom configuration and test it.
2. Develop a Python tool to log keystrokes (for educational purposes only).
3. Create a full penetration testing report for a virtual lab environment, including vulnerabilities found and mitigations applied.

## Summary

These exercises are designed to provide a mix of theoretical and practical challenges to strengthen your skills. By completing them, you will gain deeper insights into Linux system management, scripting, and cybersecurity practices.

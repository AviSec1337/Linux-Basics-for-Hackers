## üêß Introduction

This book introduces Linux concepts for aspiring hackers and cybersecurity professionals using Kali Linux. The key focus areas include:

- Installing and configuring Linux systems.
- Networking basics and advanced topics.
- Scripting with Bash and Python.
- Security and anonymity techniques.
- Practical hacking tools and techniques.

---

## Chapter 1: Getting Started with the Basics

### Key Topics:
- Installing Kali Linux on VirtualBox.
- Basic Linux commands (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `whoami`).
- Navigating the Linux filesystem.
- Using manual pages (`man`) and help commands.

#### Important Commands:
```bash
pwd        # Print current directory
ls         # List files and directories
cd <path>  # Change directory
man <cmd>  # Show manual for a command
```

---

## Chapter 2: Text Manipulation

### Key Topics:
- Viewing and modifying text files.
- Using `grep` for pattern matching.
- Combining commands like `head`, `tail`, `nl`, and `sed` for text processing.

#### Example:
```bash
cat file.txt | grep "error" > error_log.txt
```

---

## Chapter 3: Analyzing and Managing Networks

### Key Topics:
- Using `ifconfig` and `iwconfig` for network configuration.
- Changing network parameters like IP and MAC addresses.
- Inspecting DNS settings with `dig`.

#### Example:
```bash
ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

---

## Chapter 4: Adding and Removing Software

### Key Topics:
- Using package managers (`apt`, `yum`) to install, update, and remove software.
- Adding repositories to the system.

#### Example:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
```

---

## Chapter 5: Controlling File and Directory Permissions

### Key Topics:
- File and directory permissions (`chmod`, `chown`).
- Special permissions like SUID, SGID, and sticky bit.

#### Example:
```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
chown user:group file.txt
```

---

## Chapter 6: Process Management

### Key Topics:
- Viewing and managing processes (`ps`, `top`, `htop`).
- Adjusting process priorities with `nice` and `renice`.

#### Example:
```bash
ps aux | grep apache
kill -9 <PID>
```

---

## Chapter 7: Managing User Environment Variables

### Key Topics:
- Setting and modifying environment variables (`PATH`, `HOME`).
- Making changes permanent in shell configuration files.

#### Example:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/custom/path
```

---

## Chapter 8: Bash Scripting

### Key Topics:
- Writing basic Bash scripts.
- Automating tasks with loops and conditionals.
- Creating tools like a simple port scanner.

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for ip in {1..255}; do
  ping -c 1 192.168.1.$ip
done
```

---

## Chapter 9: Compressing and Archiving

### Key Topics:
- Using `tar`, `gzip`, and `bzip2` for archiving and compressing files.

#### Example:
```bash
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz directory_name
```

---

## Chapter 10: Filesystem and Storage Device Management

### Key Topics:
- Managing storage devices and partitions (`lsblk`, `mount`, `umount`).
- Checking filesystem errors with `fsck`.

#### Example:
```bash
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
```

---

## Chapter 11: The Logging System

### Key Topics:
- Understanding system logs (`/var/log/`).
- Configuring `rsyslog` for centralized logging.

---

## Chapter 12: Using and Abusing Services

### Key Topics:
- Configuring services like Apache and MySQL.
- Exploiting misconfigurations for testing.

---

## Chapter 13: Becoming Secure and Anonymous

### Key Topics:
- Using Tor, VPNs, and proxy chains.
- Configuring encrypted email and secure communications.

---

## Chapter 14: Understanding and Inspecting Wireless Networks

### Key Topics:
- Monitoring wireless networks with tools like `airmon-ng` and `airodump-ng`.
- Capturing packets for analysis.

---

## Chapter 15: Managing the Linux Kernel and Loadable Kernel Modules

### Key Topics:
- Understanding the Linux kernel architecture.
- Loading and unloading kernel modules (`modprobe`, `lsmod`).

---

## Chapter 16: Automating Tasks with Job Scheduling

### Key Topics:
- Using `cron` and `at` for task scheduling.

#### Example:
```bash
crontab -e
```

---

## Chapter 17: Python Scripting Basics for Hackers

### Key Topics:
- Writing Python scripts for automation.
- Using libraries like `socket` and `os` for hacking tools.

#### Example:
```python
import socket
s = socket.socket()
s.connect(("192.168.1.10", 80))
```

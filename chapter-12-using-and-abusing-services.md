# Chapter 12: Using and Abusing Services

## Overview

Linux services are background processes (also known as daemons) that perform various tasks. This chapter explores how to manage, configure, and troubleshoot these services, as well as test their security and functionality.

---

## 1. Understanding Services

### What are Services?
- Services are programs that run in the background to perform system-level tasks.
- Examples: web servers (Apache, Nginx), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and file-sharing services (Samba).

### Key Components:
- **Service Manager**: Manages services (e.g., `systemd`, `init`).
- **Service Files**: Define how a service starts, stops, and operates.

## 2. Managing Services with `systemctl`

### Syntax:
```bash
systemctl [command] [service_name]
```

### Common Commands:
| Command         | Description                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| `start`         | Start a service            |
| `stop`          | Stop a service             |
| `restart`       | Restart a service          |
| `enable`        | Enable service at boot     |
| `disable`       | Disable service at boot    |
| `status`        | Show service status        |

### Examples:
- Start a service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start apache2
  ```
- Check the status of a service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status apache2
  ```
- Enable a service to start at boot:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable apache2
  ```

---

## 3. Managing Services with `service`

The `service` command is a legacy tool for managing services.

### Syntax:
```bash
service [service_name] [action]
```

### Example:
- Restart a service:
  ```bash
  sudo service apache2 restart
  ```

---

## 4. Monitoring Active Services

### `systemctl list-units`
- Lists all active services.

#### Example:
```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

### `ps` and `top`
- Monitor running processes associated with services.

#### Examples:
- Check if a service is running:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep apache2
  ```
- Use `top` to monitor resource usage:
  ```bash
top
  ```

---

## 5. Configuring Services

### Modifying Service Files:
Service configuration files are typically located in `/etc/systemd/system/` or `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`.

### Example: Editing a Service File
1. Open the service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/my-service.service
   ```
2. Modify parameters (e.g., environment variables, command options).
3. Reload the systemd daemon:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
4. Restart the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart my-service
   ```

---

## 6. Testing Service Security

### Checking Open Ports
- Use `netstat` or `ss` to verify which ports are open.

#### Example:
```bash
sudo netstat -tuln
```

### Verifying Service Configuration
- Review configuration files for secure settings.
- Example: Securing SSH (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`):
  ```bash
  PermitRootLogin no
  ```

### Using `nmap` to Scan Services
- Test for open ports and vulnerabilities:
  ```bash
  nmap -sV localhost
  ```

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Services

### Viewing Logs
- Use `journalctl` to view logs for a specific service:
  ```bash
  journalctl -u apache2.service
  ```

### Debugging Failed Services
- Check the status and logs of a failed service:
  ```bash
  systemctl status my-service
  journalctl -u my-service
  ```

### Restarting the Daemon
- Restart the systemd manager if changes are not taking effect:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
  ```

---

## Summary

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Start, stop, and manage services using `systemctl`.
- Configure services through service files.
- Test and secure services using tools like `nmap` and `netstat`.
- Troubleshoot and debug service-related issues effectively.

### Next Steps:
- Move to [Chapter 13: Becoming Secure and Anonymous](chapter-13-becoming-secure-and-anonymous.md) to explore privacy and security techniques in Linux.

### Exercises

1. Start and enable a web server service (e.g., Apache or Nginx) on your system.
2. Check which ports are open on your system using `netstat`.
3. Modify the configuration of a service (e.g., change the SSH port) and restart it.
4. Use `nmap` to scan your system for open ports and running services.
5. Debug a failed service by checking its logs with `journalctl`.

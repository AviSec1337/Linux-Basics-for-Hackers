# Chapter 3: Analyzing and Managing Networks

## Overview

Networking is at the core of Linux systems, and understanding how to analyze and manage networks is a crucial skill for cybersecurity professionals. This chapter covers the tools and commands needed to inspect, configure, and troubleshoot network connections in Linux.

---

## 1. Viewing Network Interfaces

### `ifconfig`: Interface Configuration
- Displays network interfaces and their configurations.
- Deprecated on some systems; replaced by `ip`.

### `ip`: Modern Network Configuration Tool
- Provides detailed information and control over network interfaces.

### Syntax and Examples:
```bash
ifconfig                   # Display all network interfaces
ip a                      # Show all IP addresses
ip link show              # Show link-layer information
ip addr show eth0         # Show details for a specific interface (e.g., eth0)
```

---

## 2. Managing Network Interfaces

### Bring Interfaces Up or Down
- Use `ifconfig` or `ip` to enable or disable network interfaces.

#### Examples:
```bash
sudo ifconfig eth0 up       # Enable eth0 interface
sudo ifconfig eth0 down     # Disable eth0 interface
sudo ip link set eth0 up    # Enable eth0 interface with ip
sudo ip link set eth0 down  # Disable eth0 interface with ip
```

---

## 3. Testing Connectivity

### `ping`: Check Network Connectivity
- Sends ICMP packets to test reachability.

#### Examples:
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8               # Ping Google DNS
ping -c 4 example.com      # Send 4 packets to a domain
```

### `traceroute`: Trace Network Routes
- Identifies the path packets take to a destination.

#### Examples:
```bash
traceroute example.com
```

---

## 4. DNS Resolution

### `dig`: DNS Lookup
- Queries DNS servers for information about domains.

#### Examples:
```bash
dig example.com            # Perform a DNS lookup
dig +short example.com     # Show only the IP address
```

### `nslookup`: Alternative DNS Query Tool
- Provides basic DNS resolution.

#### Examples:
```bash
nslookup example.com
```

---

## 5. Network Traffic Analysis

### `tcpdump`: Packet Capturing
- Captures and inspects network packets.

#### Examples:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0       # Capture all traffic on eth0
sudo tcpdump port 80       # Capture HTTP traffic
sudo tcpdump -w capture.pcap  # Save captured traffic to a file
```

### `wireshark`: GUI for Packet Analysis
- Analyze captured traffic with a graphical interface.

---

## 6. Managing Routes

### `route`: View and Modify Routing Tables
- Displays or changes the kernel routing table.

#### Examples:
```bash
route -n                  # Display routing table
sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1  # Add a default gateway
```

### `ip route`: Modern Routing Tool
- Replaces `route` for managing routing tables.

#### Examples:
```bash
ip route show             # Display current routes
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1  # Add a default gateway
```

---

## 7. Port Scanning and Services

### `nmap`: Network Mapper
- Scans networks for open ports and services.

#### Examples:
```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24       # Scan an entire subnet
nmap -p 80,443 example.com # Scan specific ports on a domain
```

### `netstat`: Network Statistics
- Displays active connections, listening ports, and routing tables.

#### Examples:
```bash
netstat -tuln             # Show listening ports and connections
```

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Tools

### `ethtool`: Network Interface Diagnostics
- Provides detailed information and settings for network interfaces.

#### Examples:
```bash
sudo ethtool eth0         # Display details about eth0
```

### `arp`: Address Resolution Protocol
- Displays and modifies the ARP table.

#### Examples:
```bash
arp -a                    # View ARP table
sudo arp -d 192.168.1.1   # Delete an entry from the ARP table
```

### `iptables`: Firewall and Packet Filtering
- Configures network packet filtering rules.

#### Examples:
```bash
sudo iptables -L          # List all rules
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT  # Allow SSH traffic
```

## Summary

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- View and configure network interfaces.
- Test and troubleshoot network connectivity.
- Analyze network traffic using `tcpdump` and `nmap`.
- Manage routes and DNS resolution.

### Next Steps:
- Move to [Chapter 4: Adding and Removing Software](chapter-4-adding-and-removing-software.md) to learn about managing packages in Linux.

### Exercises

1. Display all active network interfaces on your system.
2. Ping your default gateway and verify connectivity.
3. Use `tcpdump` to capture HTTP traffic and save it to a file.
4. Scan your local subnet with `nmap` to identify active devices.
5. Add a new default gateway using `ip route` and verify it with `ip route show`.
